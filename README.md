that one kid who gets into programing but can never seem to settle into the right language and ACTUALLY LEARN AND PRACTINCE IT AND GETS ON OTHER STUFF AND 
ALL OF THAT
im new to programing so if you request a collab pls don't make ME do all the 100% of the hard stuff when I know like what 10% of html..
so yeah and when im in school pls no begging to do things and report ME FOR NOT DOING SOMETHING I CANT DO AT THE TIME, like ik it happens a lot
don't lie ik it does because some people are so lazy they just want to use others.
especially since I have a yt channel and if I get good at html, css and js or c++ or c# or something like that, i will start a channel for that too and 
oh god its gonna be a pain if 9 yrs watch my vids when my channel does good and I get popular like polymars++.
like the 9 yrs are going to just spam "CAN YOU PLS MAKE ME A COLLAB SITE PLS PLS PLS PLS PLS ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º " and I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPES, like even if im not
avalible or so then you will see that flooding the comments.
and that pretty much it for now






grades are a pain in heck
